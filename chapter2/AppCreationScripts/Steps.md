## Overview

This sample demonstrates a Angular SPA TodoListSPA calling a .NET Core web API TodoListAPI that is secured using Azure AD.

## Scenario

1. The client Angular SPA TodoListSPA uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to sign-in and obtain a JWT access token from **Azure AD**.
2. The access token is used as a bearer token to authorize the user to call the .NET Core web API TodoListAPI protected **Azure AD**.

## Prerequisites

- Either [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)
- An **Azure AD** tenant. For more information see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)
- A user account in your **Azure AD** tenant. This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**. Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-angular-spa-dotnetcore-webapi-roles-groups.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Step 2: Install project dependencies

```console
    dotnet restore
```

```console
    dotnet restore
```

### Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There are two projects in this sample. Each needs to be separately registered in your Azure AD tenant. To register these projects, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Azure AD Powershell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. If you have never used Azure AD Powershell before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

### Register the service app (TodoListAPI)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `TodoListAPI`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where we can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**) as per your security posture.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you select the **Add** button. Copy the generated value for use in the steps later.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, select **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **User.Read**, **GroupMember.Read.All** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an API for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.
The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this Api. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
   - Select `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
   - For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (`api://{clientId}`) by selecting **Save**.
1. All APIs have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, follow the following steps:
   - Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
        - For **Scope name**, use `access_as_user`.
        - Select **Admins and users** options for **Who can consent?**.
        - For **Admin consent display name** type `Access TodoListAPI`.
        - For **Admin consent description** type `Allows the app to access TodoListAPI as the signed-in user.`
        - For **User consent display name** type `Access TodoListAPI`.
        - For **User consent description** type `Allow the application to access TodoListAPI on your behalf.`
        - Keep **State** as **Enabled**.
        - Select the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.

#### Configure the service app (TodoListAPI) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `TodoListAPI\appsettings.json` file.
1. Find the key `Enter the domain of your Azure AD tenant, e.g. 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com'` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the key `Enter the ID of your Azure AD tenant copied from the Azure portal` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the key `Enter the application ID (clientId) of the 'TodoListAPI' application copied from the Azure portal` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `TodoListAPI` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Enter the Client Secret` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of `TodoListAPI` copied from the Azure portal.

### Register the client app (TodoListSPA)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `TodoListSPA`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Single-page application** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `http://localhost:4200/`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then:

   - Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the list of APIs, select the API `TodoListAPI`.
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **Access 'TodoListAPI'** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then:

   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, select **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **User.Read**, **GroupMember.Read.All** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

#### Configure the client app (TodoListSPA) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `TodoListSPA\src\app\app-config.json` file.
1. Find the key `Enter the client ID (aka 'Application ID')` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `TodoListSPA` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Enter the tenant ID` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the key `Enter the endpoint for TodoList web API, e.g. https://localhost:44351/api/todolist` and replace the existing value with the base address of `TodoListAPI` (by default ``).
1. Find the key `Enter the API scopes as declared in the app registration 'Expose an API' blade, e.g. api://{clientId}/access_as_user` and replace the existing value with Scope.

#### Configure Known Client Applications for service (TodoListAPI)

For a middle tier Web API (`TodoListAPI`) to be able to call a downstream Web API, the middle tier app needs to be granted the required permissions as well.
However, since the middle tier cannot interact with the signed-in user, it needs to be explicitly bound to the client app in its **Azure AD** registration.
This binding merges the permissions required by both the client and the middle tier Web Api and presents it to the end user in a single consent dialog. The user then consent to this combined set of permissions.

To achieve this, you need to add the **Application Id** of the client app, in the Manifest of the Web API in the `knownClientApplications` property. Here's how:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your `TodoListAPI` app registration, and select **Manifest** section.
1. In the manifest editor, change the `"knownClientApplications": []` line so that the array contains 
   the Client ID of the client application (`TodoListSPA`) as an element of the array.

    For instance:

    ```json
    "knownClientApplications": ["ca8dca8d-f828-4f08-82f5-325e1a1c6428"],
    ```

1. **Save** the changes to the manifest.

### Configure Security Groups

You have two different options available to you on how you can further configure your application to receive the `groups` claim.

1. [Receive **all the groups** that the signed-in user is assigned to in an Azure AD tenant, included nested groups](#configure-your-application-to-receive-all-the-groups-the-signed-in-user-is-assigned-to-including-nested-groups).
2. [Receive the **groups** claim values from a **filtered set of groups** that your application is programmed to work with](#configure-your-application-to-receive-the-groups-claim-values-from-a-filtered-set-of-groups-a-user-may-be-assigned-to) (Not available in the [Azure AD Free edition](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/)).

> To get the on-premise group's `samAccountName` or `On Premises Group Security Identifier` instead of Group ID, please refer to the document [Configure group claims for applications with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims#prerequisites-for-using-group-attributes-synchronized-from-active-directory).

#### Configure your application to receive **all the groups** the signed-in user is assigned to, including nested groups

1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Token Configuration** blade in the left to open the page where you can configure the claims provided tokens issued to your application.
1. Select the **Add groups claim** button on top to open the **Edit Groups Claim** screen.
1. Select `Security groups` **or** the `All groups (includes distribution lists but not groups assigned to the application)` option. Choosing both negates the effect of `Security Groups` option.
1. Under the **ID** section, select `Group ID`. This will result in Azure AD sending the [object id](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the groups the user is assigned to in the **groups** claim of the [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) that your app receives after signing-in a user.

#### Configure your application to receive the `groups` claim values from a **filtered set of groups** a user may be assigned to

##### Prerequisites, benefits and limitations of using this option

1. This option is useful when your application is interested in a selected set of groups that a signing-in user may be assigned to and not every security group this user is assigned to in the tenant.  This option also saves your application from running into the [overage](#groups-overage-claim) issue.
1. This feature is not available in the [Azure AD Free edition](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/).
1. **Nested group assignments** are not available when this option is utilized.

##### Steps to enable this option in your app

1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Token Configuration** blade in the left to open the page where you can configure the claims provided tokens issued to your application.
1. Select the **Add groups claim** button on top to open the **Edit Groups Claim** screen.
1. Select `Groups assigned to the application`.
    1. Choosing additional options like `Security Groups` or `All groups (includes distribution lists but not groups assigned to the application)` will negate the benefits your app derives from choosing to use this option.
1. Under the **ID** section, select `Group ID`. This will result in Azure AD sending the object [id](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the groups the user is assigned to in the `groups` claim of the [ID Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) that your app receives after signing-in a user.
1. If you are exposing a Web API using the **Expose an API** option, then you can also choose the `Group ID` option under the **Access** section. This will result in Azure AD sending the [Object ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the groups the user is assigned to in the `groups` claim of the [Access Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) issued to the client applications of your API.
1. In the app's registration screen, select on the **Overview** blade in the left to open the Application overview screen. Select the hyperlink with the name of your application in **Managed application in local directory** (note this field title can be truncated for instance `Managed application in ...`). When you select this link you will navigate to the **Enterprise Application Overview** page associated with the service principal for your application in the tenant where you created it. You can navigate back to the app registration page by using the *back* button of your browser.
1. Select the **Users and groups** blade in the left to open the page where you can assign users and groups to your application.
    1. Select the **Add user** button on the top row.
    1. Select **User and Groups** from the resultant screen.
    1. Choose the groups that you want to assign to this application.
    1. Click **Select** in the bottom to finish selecting the groups.
    1. Select **Assign** to finish the group assignment process.  
    1. Your application will now receive these selected groups in the `groups` claim when a user signing in to your app is a member of  one or more these **assigned** groups.
1. Select the **Properties** blade in the left to open the page that lists the basic properties of your application.Set the **User assignment required?** flag to **Yes**.

> :bulb: **Important security tip**
>
> When you set **User assignment required?** to **Yes**, Azure AD will check that only users assigned to your application in the **Users and groups** blade are able to sign-in to your app. You can assign users directly or by assigning security groups they belong to.

## Running the sample

> For Visual Studio Users

### The Groups Overage Claim

To ensure that the token size doesn’t exceed HTTP header size limits, the Microsoft Identity Platform limits the number of object Ids that it includes in the **groups** claim.

If a user is member of more groups than the overage limit (**150 for SAML tokens, 200 for JWT tokens, 6 for Single Page applications**), then the Microsoft Identity Platform does not emit the group IDs in the `groups` claim in the token. Instead, it includes an **overage** claim in the token that indicates to the application to query the [MS Graph API](https://graph.microsoft.com) to retrieve the user’s group membership.

> We strongly advise you use the [group filtering feature](#configure-your-application-to-receive-the-groups-claim-values-from-a-filtered-set-of-groups-a-user-may-be-assigned-to) (if possible) to avoid running into group overages.

#### Create the Overage Scenario for testing

1. You can use the `BulkCreateGroups.ps1` provided in the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/) folder to create a large number of groups and assign users to them. This will help test overage scenarios during development. Remember to change the user's **objectId** provided in the `BulkCreateGroups.ps1` script.

When attending to overage scenarios, which requires a call to [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com) to read the signed-in user's group memberships, your app will need to have the [User.Read](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/permissions-reference#user-permissions) and [GroupMember.Read.All](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/permissions-reference#group-permissions) for the [getMemberGroups](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/user-getmembergroups) function to execute successfully.

> :warning: For the overage scenario, make sure you have granted **Admin Consent** for the MS Graph API's **GroupMember.Read.All** scope for both the Client and the Service apps (see the **App Registration** steps above).

## Deployment

### Deploying web API to Azure App Services

There is one web API in this sample. To deploy it to **Azure App Services**, you'll need to:

- create an **Azure App Service**
- publish the projects to the **App Services**

#### Publish your files (TodoListAPI)

##### Publish using Visual Studio

Follow the link to [Publish with Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/deployment/quickstart-deploy-to-azure?view=vs-2019).

##### Publish using Visual Studio Code

1. Install the VS Code extension [Azure App Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice).
1. Sign-in to App Service using Azure AD Account.
1. Open the TodoListAPI project folder.
1. Choose View > Terminal from the main menu.
1. The terminal opens in the TodoListAPI folder.
1. Run the following command:

    ```console
    dotnet publish --configuration Release
    ```

1. Publish folder is created under path ``bin/Release/<Enter_Framework_FolderName>``.
1. Right Click on **Publish** folder and select **Deploy to Web App**.
1. Select **Create New Web App**, enter unique name for the app.
1. Select Windows as the OS. Press Enter.

#### Disable Azure App Services default authentication (TodoListAPI)

1. Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and locate your project there.
    - On the Settings tab, select **Authentication/Authorization**. Make sure **App Service Authentication** is `off`. Select **Save**.
1. Browse your website. If you see the default web page of the project, the publication was successful.

### Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) (TodoListAPI)

1. Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and locate your project there.
    - On the API tab, select **CORS**. Check the box **Enable Access-Control-Allow-Credentials**.
    - Under **Allowed origins**, add the site URL of your published website **that will call this web API**. 
### Deploying SPA to Azure Storage

There is one single-page application in this sample. To deploy it to **Azure Storage**, you'll need to:

- create an Azure Storage blob and obtain website coordinates
- build your project and upload it to Azure Storage blob
- update config files with website coordinates

> :information_source: If you would like to use **VS Code Azure Tools** extension for deployment, [watch the tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/javascript/tutorial-vscode-static-website-node-01) offered by Microsoft Docs.

#### Build and upload (TodoListSPA) to an Azure Storage blob

Build your project to get a distributable files folder, where your built `html`, `css` and `javascript` files will be generated. Then follow the steps below:

> :warning: When uploading, make sure you upload the contents of your distributable files folder and **not** the entire folder itself.

> :information_source: If you don't have an account already, see: [How to create a storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Locate your storage account and display the account overview.
1. Select **Static website** to display the configuration page for static websites.
1. Select **Enabled** to enable static website hosting for the storage account.
1. In the **Index document name** field, specify a default index page (For example: `index.html`).
1. The default **index page** is displayed when a user navigates to the root of your static website.
1. Select **Save**. The Azure portal now displays your static website endpoint. Make a note of the **Primary endpoint field**.
1. In the `TodoListSPA` project source code, update your configuration file with the **Primary endpoint field** as your new **Redirect URI** (you will register this URI later).
1. Next, select **Storage Explorer**.
1. Expand the **BLOB CONTAINERS** node, and then select the `$web` container.
1. Choose the **Upload** button to upload files.
1. If you intend for the browser to display the contents of file, make sure that the content type of that file is set to `text/html`.
1. In the pane that appears beside the **account overview page** of your storage account, select **Static Website**. The URL of your site appears in the **Primary endpoint field**. In the next section, you will register this URI.

##### Update the Azure AD app registration for TodoListSPA

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations**.
1. In the resulting screen, select `TodoListSPA`.
1. In the app's registration screen, select **Authentication** in the menu.
   - In the **Redirect URIs** section, update the reply URLs to match the site URL of your Azure deployment. For example:
      - `https://TodoListSPA.azurewebsites.net/`

### Update authentication configuration parameters (TodoListSPA)

1. In your IDE, locate the `TodoListSPA` project. Then, open `TodoListSPA\src\app\app-config.json`.
2. Find the key for **redirect URI** and replace its value with the address of the web app you published, for example, [https://TodoListSPA.azurewebsites.net/redirect](https://TodoListSPA.azurewebsites.net/redirect).
3. Find the key for **web API endpoint** and replace its value with the address of the web API you published, for example, [https://TodoListAPI.azurewebsites.net/api](https://TodoListAPI.azurewebsites.net/api).
